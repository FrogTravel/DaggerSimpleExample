Better to use Contruction injection whenever it is possible
Field injection is meant to be used with frameworks
Method injection is very rarely used
Constructor -> Injected fields -> Injected methods

If we cannot write @Inject (class belongs to library) we can use modules
Modules are classes that contribute to the object graph
@Module to create module class
@Provides to tell dagger how to provide specific objects and dependencies
Whenever provide methods doesn't depend on other then make methods static

@Binds whenever I want just to bind an implementation to an interface.
Gives better performance then @Provides

To runtime
